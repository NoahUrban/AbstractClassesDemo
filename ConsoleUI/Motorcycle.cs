/* 
 * Now create 2 non-abstract classes: Car and Motorcycle, that inherit from Vehicle
 * Add a distinct property in the 2 derived classes such as HasTrunk for Car and HasSideCart for Motorcycle
 * Provide the implementations for the abstract methods
 * Only in the Motorcycle class will you override the virtual drive method
